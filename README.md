# Meditation Zone 
https://meditationzone.herokuapp.com/ 
This is a project made by Malath Kamaluldeen, Daniel Narvaez, Aldora Wang, Yujing Shi, and Taylor Paydos. It is a health and wellness tool meant to provide an escape from digital anxiety and welcome digital care. Weâ€™ve created a series of interactive guided meditations that use heart rate to get in tune with the connection between the mind and body. Credit to Brian Eno for ambient music. Enjoy
